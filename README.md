This repository includes a [Protogen](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/protogen#:~:text=hence%20the%20name.-,Noun,the%20creature's%20face%20is%20displayed.) LED mask coding project I picked up for a friend going to [ACFI 2024](https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Alamo_City_Furry_Invasion). For background, I hadn't coded for about 4-7 years before this project. It was asked of me by my friend as a joke over Discord, however I got really interested when I looked more into it. There was a demo made on YouTube, described later in this document, that was the base for the project. I noticed that the coding software used for the demo mask was C++ via an Arduino board (Using Arduino IDE). Most of my coding experience was with languages such as Java and P<sup>3</sup>, but I had used Arduinos slightly during High School, so I wasn't completly unfamiliar. I did some research into the C++ language, and how it translated into the Arduino IDE. Then, I read over the code for the demo mask, and then used a derivative of Rubber Ducky debugging to more-or-less reverse engineer the program, in a way I could understand. I decided that to get the best results, that I should create my own program from scratch, using the demo code as an information suppliment, instead of just editing the demo code directly.

## The Original Code
This code is based off a repository by [@Feronium](https://x.com/feronium) on X, that was highlighted by YouTuber [Jting-F](https://www.youtube.com/@jting-f3237). You can find the original code [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RKbIPcvPq9R0P7GNYjgWqeRGMIj1SfYJ). The code uses the MaxMatrix.h library by Oscar Kin-Chung Au Â©2013, that you can also find in the original code Google Drive linked prior. I was unfortunately unable to find the original code repository, though the method described is how I myself found the library. [This Google Code link](https://code.google.com/archive/p/arudino-maxmatrix-library/wikis/Usage.wiki) describes the fuctions used by the library in more detail. This project also uses a [GitHub Program](https://xantorohara.github.io/led-matrix-editor) to create the LED bool arrays for the LED panels.


## The Hardware Side
The hardware used for this project is Arduino boards (will describe more accurately in a later push), and MAX7219 Boards, in either 8x8, or 8x32 configurations. It all runs using a 5V power supply, and is wired together via DuPont Connectors.

## The Software Side
The software side is as described, a .ino file via Arduino IDE using C++. Unfortunately, I did not start this GIT until about halfway through the project, so a lot of trial and error is undocumented (however, a lot is saved in Discord via C++ code block formatting).
